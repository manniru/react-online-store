Some basics of react in simple words:

## what are props?

props - props are like html attributes and pass this to any component. so, component will have access to props.

## what is state?

state is an object that lives with the component and responsible for keeping track of changing data within component. that change could be result of user interaction like click etc.

In other words, state is an object that lives inside a component and holds the data for self need or for its children. 

## what is ref?

ref allows us to react to reference an actual dom node on the page.

## stateless component

stateless arrow function syntax can be used instead of regular class XYZ extends React.Component.
